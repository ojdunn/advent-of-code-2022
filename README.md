## Solutions

Two problems/puzzles per day are available from Dec 1 - 25.

File name `aoc0102.py` means the first day's second puzzle solution.
Days with one file contain both puzzles for the day.

My input files needed to solve the puzzles are stored in the input directory.
`input03.txt` means the input for day 3.
